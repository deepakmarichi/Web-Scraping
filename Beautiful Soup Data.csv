Today I got a call out of the blue notifying me that in order to continue using my card I need to make a payment as they're uncomfortable with my spending this month. This is despite me having (unused) credit limits with other providers which are 7 times as large.If you don't want me to spend on my Amex card, that's fine by me. Given where we are with the global pandemic I was trying to justify keeping my account - thanks, you made that decision easier."
Just great!,Been with American Express for a large number of years and customer service is second to none. Thanks again!
I have been a American Express platinum…,I have been a American Express platinum card holder for over 40 years... Customer Service is horrific ..especially from India.The customer service provided by Amex was the very best in the business in past years...not any moreSad that after many years I might have to leave an excellent company with Bad customer service.
I applied and was accepted on an 18…,"I applied and was accepted on an 18 month 0% interest American Express card.  Early on i entered my bank details for what I believed to be my bank details for automatic collection.  Whilst on holiday last year I received a call to say I had missed my first payment.  I called them immediately and made payment and in addition set-up a DD.  The plan was to pay this off in full before the interest free period had ended.  Having got to this point I looked into what I had to pay and found out that I had paid £601 in interest. I put in a complaint to have the interest refunded.  This has been rejected by Amex.  I informed them that when I spoke to the agent and made the payment, I had told the agent that I had set-up a direct debit payment and that I believe I had asked the agent about whether this would affect me, I was informed it would not(this was over a year ago).  Amex have lost any call recordings!! They have said the DD was set-up after the first payment was due, so they can't take my word for it and I have to go to the FCA.  They also asked if I have proof for entering my bank details, which of course I do not.  They are a despicable company, you can't use their card anywhere and are in effect stealing hundreds of pounds from me when I need it the most."
American Express no longer cares about…,"American Express no longer cares about their customers.  For 35 years I have spent $40,000+/year and they no longer provide any customer service.  I have stopped using my card."
Amex is too big to care about their customers,"American Express has ZERO customer service these days! No matter how long you have been with them or how well your payment history is they DO NOT CARE and there is nothing you can do about it!  They used to be good but not anymore so if you’re looking for a partnership with a credit card company do yourself a favor and look elsewhere!  Also, I have the name of the person that was extremely rude to me today but they don’t take emails for customers to send issues to anymore so again stuck out!"
I am so annoyed with AMEX for…,"I am so annoyed with AMEX for prequalifying me for 3 of they're cards then denying me. I have good credit and don't appreciate AMEX causing a hard inquiry to deny. I have Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and all have zero balances. Guess that's who I'll always have, cause I'll never apply for an AMEX card ever again since they can't even properly evaluate a person with good credit. Lord knows what they're capable of managing my finances."
Fast customer response,Very good at sorting out missing 'shop small' credits when they didn't appear on my account.
American Express is not the company it…,American Express is not the company it was. I don't know what changed but it seems they are more skeptical about their clients than proud to support us. I really liked the early days with American ExpressI have never been late with a payment and my credit elsewhere is clean and I own a million dollar home...so I haven't changed...what is going on American Express?It seems every month my spending power decreases. It is very frustrating....and customer service is a waist of time because they just want to wish you away . If you get to the credit department its like talking to the collection account companies that most everyone had experience with over the years ...whether claims were legitimate or not...rude know it all people. The only hope is that you get a hold of upper management to help... and that is extremely difficult. I cannot depend on them as my go to credit card for business if my spending power continues to decrease. I wish it was run the way it used to be when a client build credit by their merit and payment history. Its run by know it all credit people now...who know nothing about maintaining customers...look at the reviews...2 out of 5 stars...rated poor..  No doubt!
Rubbish,Rubbish. Have been with them for years. Paid my bills on time in full every month for years. They then decide to remove my spend for no reason. I get left red-faced at the end of a supermarket shop when my card is declined. They couldn't tell me why they had restricted my credit. Also far to many places do not take amex.
BAD BAD BAD!,BAD BAD BAD!Have you tried investing in cryptocurrency?I suggest you try | www.empireinvestments. xyz | they offer very high ROI and pay out promptly.
I have to do their job,"I always give credit where good things happen, I had every faith in amex but they’ve let me down, so many times.  Fine until something goes wrong, but in disputes, they don’t fight for the consumer, or use common sense, or do what’s right.   It’s difficult to get hold of anyone who is senior and even then, they rarely do what they say they will, I have to repeat things so many times.  I’m now swapping to NatWest black and I pray that they look after me,  I’ve been really let down amex, really let down."
Bonus points with credit card not fulfilled,"I carefully and thoroughly read the T&C's for an offer. When the offer wasn't filled by Amex they made up all these extra conditions that weren't in the T&C's. When I asked to speak to the supervisor (online chat), Dave just said ""Hi"" then sent me a feedback form where you rate things but can't put in comments, and disconnected the chat. Really poor customer service and willingness to help/listen."
This AMEX Blue Card out of Texas is no…,"This AMEX Blue Card out of Texas is no more than a SCAM. And, how it works....Offer the consumer an interest free AMEX Blue Card for 15 months. They will tell you you have been approved, and send the card. No other communication, until at the end of your second month, they simply start charging you interest. So you give them a call and they simply say that you had a previous card with AMEX  where they did not make any money from you, so they decide without telling you that you will be charged interest. Then they say they notified you, and they did not. Finally you cancel the card, and refuse to pay the interest. So they report you to experian, where they reduce your credit score, and Experian believes this con job. I have had enough of scumbag CC companies like AMEX. So, BEWARE CONSUMER as no one is on your side, esp, The BBB, Everything is about corrupt ways to make money and get away with it."
American Express is a do nothing company.,If I could post a negative response I would. I had $1500 stolen from my gift cards and they say I have to contact the company that stole the money. I have requested a refund or new cards. So far Incomm says they consider all sales final. I really want my money back but if American Express is the type of business I think they are they will do nothing except continue business as usual. Their website is not secure. I checked my balances and the next day the cards were at $0.
Very fast and efficient when it comes…,"Very fast and efficient when it comes to charge disputes. They credit your account with the disputed amount on condition that the disputed company doesn't prove that the charge is valid. Other UK based credit card companies aren't that efficient and it can take an hour with them to make the call. You can also lo g disputes online with American Express, unlike other card providers."
"They'll send you the bills late, then put a black mark on your credit history for late payment!  AND charge you interest!","They sent my May bill out late, and I received it on 16th July.  Before it had even arrived they'd put a black mark on my credit history for late payment AND charged me interest.  In May I'd had £1,800 worth of CREDITS onto my card, so they actually had received a lot of money onto my card.Would they help?  NO WAY!  They say the black mark stays on my credit history, as after being a customer for 17 years it's my fault if I don't know when the bill is due!  I wish they'd given me a crystal ball to know how much to pay.A big corporation who will screw you and not give a toss.  When they screw up, you'll pay the price.  Avoid like the plague."
Worst experience ever,"Worst experience ever. Just paid off my card, and as a thank you Amex decreased my Credit Limit. No information beforehand, no communication. Funny thing is that I have never missed a payment on the card, never asked for payment holiday due to Covid19 and that is the thank you I get."
Avoid like the Plague!,"Gold Card ""The card with no limit"" When I took out the card they said ""There was no limit"" But would need to speak to them if I needed to purchase anything over £10,000. (So there was a limit) Anyway, after calling customer services found out my limit had been reduced to just £1400, for no other reason than I wasn't using it enough? They didn't even tell me! My advice is to stick with a proper bank debit card or credit card and just pay the balance off monthly. (At least you know your available credit each month) No wonder their Trustpilot rating is so low! Just in the process of closing my account!"
Amex Wall of Shame 2020,"This has to be the worst customer service I have EVER experienced to date - Amex should get a wall of shame award!  When I left Amex in 2017, I cancelled everything in order and had a credit of approx. 100 Euros left on my account - not much but still. Amex assured me the money would be transferred to my bank account within 8 weeks - fine with me, then nothing, for 8 weeks, for 12 weeks and more. I called Amex France AT LEAST 5 times (which costed me 20 Euros a pop!) as they were the responsible entity - 5 times in a row I was told the money would be transferred, during the last call I was even told Amex would be sending a bank cheque... We're now end of July 2020 and I have never recovered the funds nor got an update  or an apology from your so called customer service superstar(s). I will escalate my case with the relevant customer protection association, just to get this addressed. This is just beyond ridiculous.  😡"
