0,Business Owners AVOID at all costs..,"American Express Open... openly takes full control of your business and leaves you in the dust.You make a large purchase and use pay over time ""when approved"" then they take it away the following month making you pay the full amount or get hit with a hefty interest rate.For businesses you can not change ownership of the card. On the phone they make you think they are changing the ownership to another partner at your company but in reality they are just opening a new account under the new card holder. Our business lost our American Express account, once we approved the transfer and the receiving member in our LLC accepted it. American express did a hard pull on their personal credit and he was denied. Now we had no control over our account. No logins, no cards, because the receiver was not approved.Lets just say we will never use American Express again for any personal, business, financing and will tell everyone within our network to make the switch. I asked to talk to a manager and customer support said no. This is a horrible company that strives off annual payment fees, shady pay over time approval and denials and high interest rates.All business owners avoid at all costs.EDIT: I have been a business customer with AMEX for 3 years, don't get stuck with them like we did."
1,"Look elsewhere...Visa, MasterCard or Discover are WAY BETTER","So I requested a credit line increase because American Express only give me $1,000 credit limit. Since the limit is so small I use it and then I pay it off right away. Yes my credit may not be perfect it's about 663. But given the fact that I have other cards such as Wells Fargo Visa, discover, capital one Quicksilver, and two Credit Union Visas American Express would not even raise my limit to $1,500. My credit utilization at this time is at 15%. So what I'm going to do is stop making purchases with this card and rely on my other cards that actually value me as a customer."
2,AMERICAN EXPRESS - THE COMPANY YOU CAN'T RELY ON,Booked a holiday & paid by American Express for nearly £5200. Holiday was cancelled by tour operator & American Express have refused to give me my money back 2 months after holiday should have taken place.despite the fact that under S75 they are jointly responsible with the travel company. AMERICAN EXPRESS - THE COMPANY YOU CAN'T RELY ON
3,Never get an amex card,flights cancelled with airline.Been trying for weeks to get refund from useless amex. Easy with Nationwide Visa so do yourselves a favour and get any visa card but never ever an amex card.
4,The Platinum Perennial Torture!,"The Platinum Perennial Torture!Despite being Amex Biz Platinum customer paying full fees for 3 years, American Express Customer Services sucks every time.Their service is rude and every time I get transferred to 4 different times before I am told they cannot help."
5,Good customer support,Great company. Resolved my issues
6,Wonderful Customer Service!!!,I've never had customer service answer me so quickly and they fixed my problem in less that a minute. Very polite as well. Wonderful customer service!!!
7,I had a dispute opened with TravelUp.,"I had a dispute opened with TravelUp.Whereas my hotel was closed and refunded TravelUp, and TravelUp cancelled the booking I discovered that TravelUp won the case.I asked Amex for more details, and they told me TravelUP provided their T&C. BUT they have UPDATED their T&C after I paid. And they provided the new one to Amex.It’s illegal, and Amex dispute service wasn’t even able to see it’s illegal ! Ask to escalate to section 75 and bring Amex to small claim court !"
8,The worst!,I would give their customer service a Zero if I could!
9,So unhelpful with disputes and customer service,"I applied for a refund to Ryanair as our flights were cancelled due to Coronavirus. Their Disputes process was bad enough and they sent me a voucher instead of a refund. Having paid £140 a year for a gold card with Amex I knew part of this was the protection they offer as part of the benefits. Was I wrong!! The Disputes Team asked for information which I couldn’t upload (their systems say it’s too big). After multiple chats I resorted to phoning them. I then had a letter advising they're closing the dispute, because they never received any correspondence from me. I then had to call the customer service team to have the dispute reopened and they told me the inbox with my information was deleted as the person I spoke with had not advised the Dispute Team to expect me email. I sent it again and repeated the whole process. I have received another generic letter to say the information was insufficient and they have closed the dispute. They never pick up the phone to discuss the matter with you. They advertise themselves as having your back but they really don’t. They make all of the right noises on the phone but dealing with them is like banging your head up against a brick wall. Avoid American Express. Reading about other high street banks, they seem to be treating their customers better."
10,2nd review trying to pay my bill,"2nd review trying to pay my bill, DCM called me last week told me they are now handling my account ( husband passed away they cancelled my cards, bill not due yet and we pay it off every month!) told her to send me bill as I always paid it on line, and now I can't since cards cancelled) said she would send out bill. HERE it is a week later and still not a bill, I called and spoke with Chloe who told me today to call DCM since they are handling it. REALLY??????just send me a bill and don't ruin my credit!!!!!!!Would definitely NOT recommend this company!!!!!!!"
11,I have been with American express for 6…,"I have been with American express for 6 years never missed a payment always pay more than asked and today I receive an email they were reducing my credit limit by 6,742.00 on one card and £2,00 on another I have good credit and was amazed.  I told them that during these times they should be helping customers but I am so annoyed I will now pay off my cards sent my cards back and never use them again.  Just goes to show what lenders are helpful and what lenders are not.  Don't get a card with American Express they are the most unhelpful loan cards you could get go with Barclaycard they have been brilliant through this difficult time."
12,American Express has the worst customer…,American Express has the worst customer service ever.  I have been a platinum member for 30 years and they just gave me the run-around like nothing I have ever experienced.
13,Nasty company,Nasty company ! They don't tell the truth ! They are the worst customer service on the planet !They probably use the governor of New York to make decisions !  They will tell how wonderful they are wile there screwing you behind your back ! They say there worldwide guess what I'm not!  You'll be transferred to the Philippines  so what you will need is a translator to understand because  you can't understand a word they're saying !
14,Perfect,"Guys, I never had ANY issue using my AMEX and never had ANY issue w/the customer support. What else can I say?! Perfect!"
15,They're terrible,"They're terrible, and even worse when you need to dispute a charge on your card.   They promise to call you back and investigate complaints, but never get back to you, even when you're persistent and keep calling them for over a year in relation to the same matter.Their Disputes team ask for information in relation to a disputed charge, then send you a letter advising they're closing the dispute, because they never received any correspondence from you, even though you may have spent hours compiling all the evidence and sending it to them.  Then you have to call the customer service team to have the dispute reopened, and the process just keeps repeating itself.  Their disputes team just send you generic letters that aren't even in context to the situation.   Dealing with Amex is like banging your head up against a brick wall.  Avoid this company!"
16,Been with Amex for five years in good…,"Been with Amex for five years in good standing only to wake up during COVID and my card be denied. NO email, no call, just that your revolving balance is too high, not close to my limit but revolving balance. The impact of this is on my credit. no lender will lend to someone with a maxed out credit. Thank you AMEX for damaging my credit that i fought so hard to keep."
17,I want to give a ZERO star,"I want to give a ZERO star, but I can not. They stolen money from me after I applied for a credit card to get $250 as a credit, they said to me that there is not any credit amount that I can get. Do NOT apply for skymlles credit card because it is a fake. they lost a customer."
18,Pathetic and Inconsiderate during this pandemic..Get another card.,"I have to write this review because of disappointment.As most of here have bad reviews on how they treat customer during this pandemic.I just pray and hope this company will bankrupt and all of their employees will be jobless and free of us all in credit.The've sent me an e-mail couple of days ago for a reason that they will reduced my credit because of the review they have had conducted ,they reduced my credit limit and  not allowing  me to any cash advances which i never use.What is appalling was the time of doing this review  ,I never request for a payment relief for my card payment as I still pay on time and with no problem,the disgusting part is they have to do this during this pandemic because of their review.I got savings but won't pay in full this balance now,but after this pandemic and I will sort this out and NEVER USE or RECOMMEND it to anyone,they encourage you to be a member ,but AMEX will never assist or concern of your situation..they are just pretending they care,but they are not.To all of you using it,as much as possible ,sort and pay your outstanding balances and close or move to another credit card company.I just wish this company will hit badly and they go burst."
19,I have been a card holder member of…,"I have been a card holder member of American Express for 29 years. My payment was due on May 6, 2020. I forgot to call back to make the payment on May 6, 2020, due to all of the stress with the pandemic and learning that friends of the family have passed away. I called around 7am the next morning and made a payment and $40 late fee was already charged to my account not to mention that they are already getting around $70-$115 in interest charges from me every month. When I called back to ask about waiving the late fee, I was denied. I asked to speak with a supervisor and I was told that the supervisor was off.  This is the thanks that I get after being a valued member for almost 30 years and  during the time that I need it most.  Through the grace of God I was able to borrow the money to pay it off in full in hopes that I don't find myself in this situation ever again. After I paid it in full another charge along with the late fee appeared on my account. I called American  express back and they informed me that there were interest charges I asked again for the late fee and interest charges to be waived. They finally waived the late fee. I appreciate that. The interest charge was  denied."
